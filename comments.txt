In table.py:
   playerID is a tuple containing the player numbers which uniquely identify them
   players is a list containing the player objects in the order they are sitting
   cycleID contains two times the player IDs (0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3) to facilitate circular iteration
   dealer is the index (referred to playerID) of the player who deals the card for the round
   orderedPlayers is a list containing the player object rearranged so that the first one in the list is the
   		  first to receive cards, and to play. This makes matters way easier when handing out cards
		  and when playing them. It needs to be updated every round (=every time the dealer changes)
    whoDeals() and whoPlays() return both the index (referred to playerID) and the player objects of the
    	          dealer and the first player
    order() is a function to order the players after having changed the dealer. It is automatically called when updating the dealer


What needs to be done next:
     - implement the points
     - IMPORTANT: WHAT IS THE RULE IF AN 8 AND A 7 OF TRUMP ARE
     PLAYED, AND NO OTHER TRUMPS? they boty have 0 value (this is only
     valid in the 'simple' rules, and since they are made up, but a
     good check for the functionalities, it could be good to have a
     strategy for that situation)
